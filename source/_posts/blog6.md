1. Love the Problem, Not Your Solution

People spending effort to build something nobody wants. A lot of people they are thinking about their idea is very good and start to build it immediately without finding the customer, they never do research about the market and find out their potential customers. Customers don't care about your solutions, they care about their problems, no matter how great your product is. Traditionally, people building a key without a door, then try to figure out what door to open. But a better alternative is switch perspective, start with understanding a problem before building a solution, this becomes a lot easier after that.

>A problem well-defined is a problem half-solved. - Charles Kettring

2. The Business Model is the Product

Market * Product = Profit

We need to ensure we have a problem that worth to solve and it's monetizable from the customer's pain point. Entrepreneur not just building a solution to a problem, but building a working business model is more important. Scientists use models to simplify a problem, make predictions and validated through experiments. Entrepreneur can do the same with business models. A good business model can create value for customers by solving a problem they wanted to solve.

3. Traction is the Goal

Traction is tempting to measure a working business model in terms of revenue or profit. It can be the rate of a business that captures monetizable value from its customers. We can show the growth in traction to get attention from investors. We can find an example from Facebook, it is a social media platform but captures value from advertisers who buy attention and data. Daily active users (DAU) can predict future revenue from advertisers, this is what called Traction.

4. Right Action, Right Time

Most of the entrepreneurs are trying to go fast on everything. But going fast on everything doesn't necessarily make us go faster. Sometimes we wanted to get everything done but we didn't think about which one is the priority or which one is most valuable. We try to optimize our product when we have no customers. We try to raise funding without any traction. The goal of entrepreneur is to find a business model that works before running out of resources. Time is the scarcest resource compare with others, we waste a lot of time to build a perfect product that no customer wants.

5. Give Yourself Permission to Scale

Three specific stages in a hockey-stick curve in the product lifecycle also known as Traction.

>Problem / Solution Fit  ->  Product / Market Fit  ->  Scale

Problem / Solution Fit: Finding a problem worth solving, get paying customers without having to first build out a fully functioning solution.

Problem / Market Fit: Demonstrating a working business model with just a few good customers. A minimum viable product can test your business model fast and without wasting resources.

Scale: Once we have repeatability in a working business model, we can shifting focus to growth. We can test the full potential of a business model by scaling a product to support multi types of customers.
