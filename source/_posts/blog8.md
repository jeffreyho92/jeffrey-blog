Back then, 2017, when I working in Panasonic Senai. Our factory has a department named Corporate Purchase, all the members in this department who will be handling raw materials and finished goods, so-called Inbound and Outbound. It is a very complex process with cumbersome workflow, every member had to cooperate with other departments. For the material purchasing team, they had to work with vendors to ensure all the material can arrive on time. For the finished goods team, they had to work with the Logistics department to make sure the goods can be ship out on schedule. In order to manage this huge workflow and improve their work efficiency, they need an Inventory System to enhance their workflows.

As a software engineer in the Information System Department, I have the opportunity to join in this project with my manager and senior manager to implement an Inventory System. The goal of this system is to reduce their workload and prevent human error in their process. To achieve this target, we have to study the whole process and understand the details in each workflow. 

In the inbound delivery process, when the raw materials came in, store members have to verify the item and check the quantity is correct, update it in system and move into the warehouse. This is a heavy-duty workload and it can cause a lot of human error. Therefore, we implement a barcode system to help them to manage the stock and improve traceability in goods movement.

In the outbound delivery process, when the finished goods had been done packing, store members have to move the finished goods to the Logistics department to do the shipment, pallet by pallet. In order to operate smoothly with each department, we have to implement a system to manage this workflow and conduct the process.

This project brings me a chance to broaden my horizons, I learned a lot of different things from my field, and get the experiment to work in a multi-channel group.
