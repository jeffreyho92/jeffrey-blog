Most people fail to develop a new habit most of the time. One of the most common mistakes is that people intend to build a strong habit and start from a difficult task. It is a bit like going to the gym for the first time and trying to lift the heaviest weights. This is not the best way to start exercising. Most people understand that we need to build our strength from our present level. This concept applies to forming any new habits.

Start from small with the initial habit. When we want to get into the habit of exercise every day, don't expect to start from the hardest and exhaust ourselves. If we start from a high standard such as workout for two hours every day, we will feel too hard to achieve and can't maintain consistently. 
Exercise for two hours every day is a great obstacle, which we can't overcome if we don't accumulate strength.

When we start to build a new habit, the most important thing is not about the task, it's about building the habit of getting ourselves to do the task. Once we get into the habit of letting ourselves do the task, then we can focus on increasing the intensity or increase the time of the task. Therefore, in the beginning, we should make the obstacle as low as possible, so that it's easier and non-intimidating. 

Instead of doing two-hour straight, we could start with a 15-minute routine, and then increase it slowly. Even when we feel tired or lazy, it can be done. In other words, the lower barrier, the higher success rate, and a higher success rate, the greater the achievement.

Starting from a small place and increasing the load over time goes by is the most sustainable way to build a new habit, so that we can become unstoppable.
