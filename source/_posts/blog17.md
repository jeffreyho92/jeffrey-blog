>A dream is just a dream. A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline. - Harvey Mackay

Goal setting is such an important process to achieve your plan or target, it involves action plans and measurable targets, it can be used in your life or your career. A goal is like a compass, it is able to help you to stick to your plan and let you know where you are, it will bring you a clear image of your thought. 

Sometimes we are seeking new things in our life, we wanted to do something that we thought is good for us, we want to change our life, leave the comfort zone though it is not easy. We can step out of the first step, think about what we want, and how to get it. We can set a goal and start to plan about it, take action, it will motivate us in the process. 

Working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals, create an action plan for it. The action plan is what you need to do to achieve the goal you set, the requirement to get on your goal, and the difficult part to achieve it. Follow the plan and implement it step by step, bit by bit, this process can be very tough it depends on what you want. To keep in track of your plan and obtaining your goal,  you need to work on your plan consistently and get the result in the end. A lot of things that are not as a fast game, we are nothing working hard to get the things first but to keep the things lasting. Doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process.

Do the things simple, and repeat doing the simple things. Setting a goal is simple but important, we can have a clear image of what we want instead of doing everything that we think we should. Set a simple goal, get a hard result.
