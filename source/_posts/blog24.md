Sometimes, we are used to enjoying doing small things and make it looks perfect since it is easy to get done and we can get the result response immediately, though, it is not interesting. People like to do things that are able to get immediate responses and feel easy to do it, like reply email or doing a small task, it lets us feel that we are doing something. However, it didn't bring much value to our time.

Big things are something that not easy to achieve, it requires us to give hard work on it, and takes time to work on it to get some outcomes. Most of the time, we are procrastinating to work on the big things since it needs more effort, more focus, and consume more time on it. However, it will bring a huge effect on our life when we achieve it, it worth our time to spend on it. 

>It's more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly. - Ray Dalio

Get things done and make life easy. I'm still learning to make the small things done but not make it perfect. Sometimes, when I doing the small things, I like to make it perfect and waste a lot of time in the details. Nevertheless, stop being a perfectionist is a good achievement.

Begin with the end in mind, Stephen Covey wrote in his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. When we get started to do something, we can make a clear vision of the desired direction and destination, imaging the thing that had been completed, and how will it looks like. This action can give us some motivation to work on it and make things happen, done lately is better than no progress.

Value your time and waste your time in something that makes values in your life.
