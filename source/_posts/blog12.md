When I was working in Panasonic Senai, back than 2016, the production planning department is such a huge and complicated department around one hundred staff, they are managing production plans, raw material plans, delivery plans, shipment plans, and all the production products. The complicated part is they need to cooperate with multiple parties, members from other departments, and outside vendors, they need to ensure the production line can run smoothly. This business process runs a highly important part of a manufacturing company.

Everything starts from the Sales Order. They receive the Sales Order from Panasonic Japan with the target shipment date, normally they will receive the order 6 months in advance. They need to calculate the raw material from the required products to start planning the production. They contact the suppliers of the raw material and manage the estimated delivery date, so they can start planing the production line and arrange production shifts. After that, they need to work with the Logistics member for the shipment date and reply estimated arrived date to customers. 

Plans always fall behind changes. Sometime the production plan will be affected by multiple issues such as delayed material delivery, production quality control issues, etc. They need to respond immediately and roll out a new production plan to prevent the delay of arriving in customers, like fire fighting. There are a lot of complicated processes and manual works.

In order to optimize the business process and prevent human error, we control most of the processes in our ERP system, SAP. Most of the documents will go through the system and connect with vendors and suppliers, but they still need to do human decisions like production planning and forecast. I had been assigned to create a system for them with the production forecast planning. This system will collect all the Sales Order and the raw material dataset to calculate and forecast the production plan. It also connects with the Inventory system to highlight the material shortage in a dashboard, so they can easy to monitor the raw material with the production plan.

I got this opportunity to study and understand the production business process, this is a rare experience for me and I can't easily learn about it from other companies, this experience brings me forward in my career.
