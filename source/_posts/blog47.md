We already hear people say something doesn't work since nobody does the thing this way. We didn't find out why we can't do it, because of physical limitations or it is just something we can improve, but no one was doing it. We already got biased with convention or analogy to prior experiences. We are too used to think in an old way based-on previous experience since it's always been done that way. However, we can try to think of something on a first-principles basis, that's used in physics. We should look at the fundamentals and construct our reasoning from that, and then see if we have a conclusion that works, and it may be different from what people have done before.

Reasoning from first principles removes the assumptions and conventions. What remains is the essentials. It is a mental model we can use to improve our thinking because the essentials allow us to see where reasoning by analogy might lead to biases. The idea is to break down complicated problems into fundamental elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. This is one of the best ways to learn how to think about everything and also different perspectives that we miss.

This can happen in sports as well. A normal coach does what has already been done, and maybe he adds some tweaks, but he is just copying something that someone created before. But a good coach knows what he can and can't do. He understands how he loses a game and how to improve on it. Everything is possible as long as it is not against the rules.

>If we never learn to take something apart, test the assumptions, and reconstruct it, we end up trapped in what other people tell us â€” trapped in the way things have always been done. When the environment changes, we just continue as if things were the same.
