Everyone has opinions, either opinion from you to other people's things, or opinions from other people that give you, it can be good or bad, neither all. Dealing with other people's opinions can be tough since you don't know that is good or bad for you, people may think it is good maybe it works for them, but actually, it can be bad for you.

When you dealing with the opinion that you don't agree with and the person insists on giving you his opinion and want you to make a decision on it. At this point, opinion becomes troublesome, how to decline people's opinion is like a martial art. We can't straightaway reject the opinion, we need to handle it without affecting our relationship, we need to articulate our thoughts more clearly, and don't be emotional.

>Don't treat all opinions as equally valuable - Ray Dalio

Sometimes the opinion that works on other people but may not works on our own. Learning how to recognize a good opinion it takes time to gain from experiences but it is an essential skill in our life. When we took the opinion and realized it is bad for us, the first time what we need to do is make a reflection on it, instead of blaming other people.

Don't argue for other people's opinions. Don't argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it. We should get improve from other people's opinions, rather than become worst from it. We can don't follow the opinion if we thought it is not useful for us, it depends on different situations and the way you see it through.

Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. The opinion is thought from other people but implements on our own. We should take responsibility for it, think about the opinion with our personal situation, instead of following blindly. Don't be in blind faith and avoid the herding effect.
