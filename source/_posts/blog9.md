When I working in Panasonic Senai, there is a department by the name of Logistics. The Logistics department is mainly working on shipping and delivery. Most of the time they are busy arranging shipment for finished products which ship to oversea. Overall orders are come from Panasonic Japan but shipped out to customers in the US and UK. The job scope of the Logistics department is organizing the deal date of orders with shipment date, they have to work closely with the Production department and the vendors for shipment. 

The common problems that happen in the Logistics department are redundant processes, inaccurate inventory layout, and lack of efficiency. They need a system to help them to reduce high labor costs and prevent human error. In Panasonic Senai, all the Sales Order and Shipping Instruction are going through our ERP system. Logistics members can do the planning, forecast, and manage shipment with the system and work more efficiently. However, for the physical goods, they need a good facility layout and spaces to manage the packing process, therefore we implement a system to resolve this issue.

As a software engineer in the Information System Department, I have the opportunity to join in the project to study the whole process and design the solution called Pallet Checker System. This system is a helper that works with members when they do the packing process. Members have to scan all the products during warping, pallet by pallet. It can ensure the packed finished products are matched with Shipping Instruction so that we are not sending the wrong product to the wrong customer. This system also enhances the storage shortage issue with the scheduled shipment that needs to be ship out on time.

This is a fresh experience for me since I never study the process of Sales Order and Shipping Instruction, this project helps me a lot to gain new exposure in the manufacturing business process.
