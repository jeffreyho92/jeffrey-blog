I have been working in a manufacturing company (Panasonic) as an in-house software developer. The scopes of in-house software are supporting internal business workflows, improve productivity and increase product quality. Since all software is used by our employees, so as a software developer, I have to understand our company's business workflows and what are they doing in each department.

I still can remember when I had been assigned to support a Purchase Request system. I have to work with the Corporate Purchasing Department. I did the feasibility study of purchasing workflow. It is quite a complicated workflow involved clerk, purchaser, administrator, and vendor. A purchase request basically can split into two categories which are Regular Request and Ad-hoc Request. The Regular Request is repeatable every week or every month, so it has a fixed vendor. The Ad-hoc Request is a special request like ordering a machine or purchase a service. The ad-hoc request needs management to approve and get acknowledgment.

In order to get a clear idea of the process, I have to follow the purchaser run through the whole process, like a clerk submit a request form to request purchase, the administrator verifies the request and gets approval from management. Finance has to approve the request then the purchaser submits a purchase order to the vendor and gets the delivery timeline from the vendor. Each of the workflows needed a clear vision and well designed in the system.

I realized that every department is working as a chain that links with each other. It required a lot of communication and good cooperation between each employee. As a software developer, I have to communicate with people coming from different backgrounds, get experience from them and sometimes I have to learn how to convince them when needed.
