When you think about how you will become in the future, who you will be in the future, and you look at your present and future selves as two different people. What you need to do to become the person you desire to be, the things that you doing now will benefit your future self. This is an important question that we need to ask ourselves, it is essential for our self-growth and become a better person.

Visualize about the future negative consequences that your future self will experience, what skill is required to overcome these negative moments, it can be a positive mindset or mentally strong heart, experiencing more things will make us stronger. Keep trying new things and learn from it is the key, the more you know the more you realize you don't know. Go through all the things that happened in our life, good things or bad things all are valuable. Taking responsibility when you screw up, admit our mistake is the first step to conquer it.

Change only comes from taking action not just knowing about it. Every time we realize we need to do something for our future self, we need to take immediate action on it, I know sometimes it can be tough though.

The way you do anything is the way you do everything, we should start from a very tiny step on small things that can keep improving ourselves, it could be just a 5 mins exercise every day, but it will make a big impact in our life. Start building a new habit for future self, give them a healthy life, they will be grateful for us in taking these minor actions.
