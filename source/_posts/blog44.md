> You should take the approach that you're wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong. - Elon Musk

As Elon Musk said, being wrong or failed is always an option because if you are not, means you are not improving.

We all make mistakes, and we do it regularly without noticing it. No one enjoys being wrong, it is a negative emotional experience for all of us. The important thing is how do we respond when it happened to us. Some people will take responsibility and address it quickly. Some people will feel embarrassing to admit their mistake. Some people stubbornly denying being wrong and escape from the failure. People's egos and emotions will make thing goes worth even they know it is wrong, it is hard to control the emotions.

Don't try to shift the blame to other people. Other people might make mistakes or do wrong things with us, but we should focus only on our part. We should not argue that the mistake is caused by others. Even if they don't admit it, but we know that we did the right thing by admitting our wrongs.

We all know admitting we are wrong is a virtue and having this habit will benefit us in our life. Struggling to admit our fault can harm our interpersonal relationship. Admitting we are wrong doesn't mean that we are a loser. In fact, being able to own up to our mistakes takes a lot of courage and self-awareness. It is a sign of improvement. People won't consider us a bad guy instead, they would probably respect our guts and sincerity.

After admitting and owning the mistake, we should do reflection, walking through the mistake, and learn from it provided we don't repeat the same mistakes. The ability to fail, learn something new, and then find a solution until it works.
