6. Prioritize Your Riskiest Assumptions

Since startups are inherently risky, it follows that the best strategy for protecting the downside is prioritizing the riskiest. If we apply stress to the chain, it will break at its weakest link. We have to find out the weaknesses of the business model and the risky part so that we can avoid the chance of failure. Focus on the riskiest, settle the hardest part as a priority, it is very tough at the beginning but it will help us afterward.

7. Think 10X

A thousand miles begins with a single step. All businesses are started with one customer, they then grow to at least 10 customers, and most likely 100 customers, that's two 10X jumps right there. Sometimes we are overthinking and scaled too early. We can have a growth strategy but it must be reasonable, we have to understand the reality and know where we are. Focus on traction instead of revenue or profit.

8. Make Evidence Driven Decisions

From plan A to a plan that works before running out of resources. We can systematically test our models and plans using small and fast experiments that stress testes the riskiest assumptions.

Two types of experiments:

Discovery experiments: interviewing customers to understand their problems.
Throughput experiments:  measuring traction, measuring changes in customer behavior towards a new feature.

We have to seek feedback from customers. When we looking at a business from an individual perspective, it is not accurate since it can have a lot of bias. Here is some advice to avoid this matter:
Source a diversity of ideas: good ideas can come from anywhere, we can diverse sets of possible solutions to a problem, it can from a designer or marketer.
Rank your ideas: finding a shortlist of solutions, deliver the biggest impact for the least amount of effort.
Test your idea: run a throughput experiment to test the selected idea, if it increases in traction then continue on it.

9. Validate Qualitatively, Verify Quantitatively

If we launch a landing page and the conversion isn't great, we can systematically change it and retest the landing page. But fixing issues can take a long time, we have to throughput an experiment and measure the amount of effort.

10. Remove Failure From Your Vocabulary

As a scientist, many discoveries started as failed experiments. But instead of throwing away their "failed" experiments. they did something very different from most people; they asked why. Breakthrough insights are often hidden within failed experiments. Before we can find a business model that works, we have to go through lots of stuff that doesn't work. The taboo of failure runs so deep, we have to understand the realities and admit our failure, we have to accept our weaknesses and improve on it, accept failure as a prerequisite to achieving the breakthrough.
