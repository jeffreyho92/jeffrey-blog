Every time I feel like want to prepare everything before getting started, doing a lot of research and planning, but sometimes not even start to do it. We are enjoying the moment of preparing, planning, imaging, getting ready, but we felt uninterested when start doing it.

Sometimes we are looking for a good plan to get ready, wanted to get a perfect job done, imaging the plan a hundred times in mind, but plan can't keep up with changes. Sometimes experiences and the ability to deal with changes are more important than a perfect plan.

>Principles. You don't have to know everything to get what you want. You just have to be honest with yourself about what you don't know and know who to ask for help. - Ray Dalio

I think doing while learning is better than learning for doing. To be honest, I prefer practical knowledge compare with theoretical knowledge, I'm a practical person, I learned something from doing it not studying it, I felt like I can understand more in real-life hands-on experiences, instead of the theory of knowledge that learn from books. 

Recognize the power of knowing how to deal with not knowing. The fast learner is better than a smart person. The fast learner can deal with a different situation and learn a new skill to overcome it. The smart person will fail when the situation is not good for him when he can't deal with it, he does nothing.

Understand that the ability to deal with not knowing is for more powerful than knowing. We should not feel shame when we are not a smart person, we should feel shame when we can't learn something from it and improve it, even though just a little bit. When we know the problem, we already solved half of the problem.
