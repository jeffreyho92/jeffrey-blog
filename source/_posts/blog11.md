When I working in Panasonic Senai, we have a department by the name of C&R, C&R stands for Configuration and Repair. They are doing a repair service for the end-user who using the Panasonic laptop. Most of the customers have come from Panasonic Singapore or other corporate end-user. This repair service business model has good potential since Panasonic Taiwan is the only main provider in Asia. Previously, this Repair Service is provided by Panasonic Singapore, but due to the high labor costs, we try to undertake this business since we have an unfair advantage in the operation costs. Panasonic Singapore also agrees to move their customers to us.

Panasonic Senai becomes the window person who provides repair service. Customers ship their device to us by post service and C&R members will receive it and start doing their operation. They have to record down all the serial numbers of the devices to prevent miss-match with the wrong customer. After they complete the diagnosis of device and feedback to the customer if they wanted to repair or send back to them. C&R member has to check the warranty information if the device is still under warranty or the device was configured by the C&R Configuration team. There are some complicated workflows involved in human processes. They have to do diagnosing with following the documentation and instruction provider by Panasonic Japan. They have to handle customer service and feedback, sometimes they have the warranty issues in the system.

We implemented a system to assist them to manage all the business processes, everything will log in system, so this will enhance the traceability of their repair jobs. This system will help them to control the goods-in and goods-out process to prevent human error. Since their repair parts can share with the Configuration team, we implement inventory management in the system and forecast the usage of the repair parts, this will help them on the inventory purchase request. This process will reduce the customer waiting time when their repair part is not available.

This system was developed by Japan members but handover to me to maintain it. I also do the enhancement with C&R members to improve the business process and reduce operator workload. This gave me a good opportunity to learn new things and improve myself.
