Most of the time people will ignore soft skills and focus on improving technical skills. People think soft skills are not easy to learn or we can't improve them. However, we should treat soft skills the same way we would any technical skills.

First, where should we start? Think about our current job and the next job we are wanted to go for. What are the skills do successful people in those jobs have? Does the job involve communication with other types of people, technical and non-technical? Does having strong communication skills will benefit it?

Think about the last time we exercised the skill. Were we having any problems with communication? Are we able to convince other people about our idea? I'm pretty sure we must have some bad experiences when we talking to people or colleagues. Where we fell short and what we can do to get better next time. 

We can do some research such as how to convince people about your idea, or how to make people want to listen to you. There are a ton of techniques that we can learn and practice with our coworkers or family members, even strangers. Try to push ourselves outside of our comfort zone. It does not hurt to try something new. Get comfortable with failure and keep improving and listen to feedback.

Seeking feedback makes us stronger. If someone does not like our idea, ask why and try to understand where they are coming from and what are their expectation. Sometimes an outside perspective can help us identify and understand our weaknesses. Positive and negative feedback both are important. It might be hurt at first, but we will learn faster than we do alone. 

Whatever we do, make it a habit. Work on it and make a little improvement every day.
