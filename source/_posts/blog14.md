Quality Control (QC) is a very important part of a manufacturing company, they have to ensure the products they produce have no issue and in good quality. When I working in Panasonic Senai, Quality Control is the most focused process along with the production since the vision of Panasonic is to produce the product that can be lasting a long period with good quality. When a customer reported a quality issue in a Panasonic product, we need to recall all the products produced in the same patch even the product was ship to oversea.

We do the Quality Control process starts from raw material, production line, finished goods, and packing before it ships to customers. These whole processes are running with some tools and managed in the system. When the raw material arrived in the store warehouse from vendors, QC members will go and take some raw materials as sampling for the Quality Control process, they doing this process with system control. The system will record down the material and quantity that being Quality Control process and reflect into stock quantity, this will help the store members to manage the stock and prevent stock missing or stock quantity not tally. 

In the production line, we have some tools to test the functionality of the product, we use OCR with a high-quality camera to check the assemble process and installation process, this can prevent the human mistake like installing a part with the wrong direction. 

During the packing process, production operators pack the completed product in a box with some user manual and some documentation. In order to prevent human mistakes like missing user manual with the packed box, we implement a system by the name of Weight Checker System. This system will pre-configured with the weight of the packed product and the allowed differences in milligrams, it will trigger an alert when the weight of the packed product is not in the range of the standard weight, it means something wrong in the packing.

This is a good opportunity for me to learn more about the business processes in a manufacturing company and the Quality Control is really important for a company, it can deploy a company if some bad thing happen.
