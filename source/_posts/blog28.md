Whenever something bad happened, it may make someone worst or there could be an opportunity for someone to get better. Everything has two sides, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Crisis entails opportunities, we should try to look at the other side to avoid bias, though it is not easy but doable.

During this pandemic, a lot of people start doing digital marketing, they saw other people are doing something, so they also want to follow the trend, but this fall into the herd mentality, people can be influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.

>It's not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change. - Charles Darwin

Should we follow other people doing the same things to avoid falling behind, or should we accommodate ourselves to adopt the new changes in the environment, I prefer the second one. When we follow the trend, doing the same things as other people doing, we are stuck in the 80% crowd, we can't stand out in this situation. 

The other option is don't follow other people but improve ourselves to stay in the game, learning new skills that essential to survive in the environment. I think this is better than following other people back since we are growing with new experiences and it doesn't hurt to trying new things. Even though step out of our comfort zone and overcome the challenges in a new environment is not easy, we are taking a risk and opening ourselves up to the possibility of stress, it will be tough but it is worth spending effort on it.

Even if I fail now, the skills I have acquiring will be valuable in the future, it will become my weapon to fight the next challenges.
