Nowadays, people are going to cultivate the habit of celebrating busyness. Most people are proud of being busy, just like having an honor badge on it. People think as long as we are doing a lot of things mean that we can expect to achieve success. I think it is interesting to see how some people block the productivity they seek. Those who aggressively run around all day to be the busiest, which is usually rewarded with compliments and promotion. 

However, I think this is the wrong thing to be proud of and nothing to celebrate. Being busy does not mean being productive. Being busy has nothing to do with bringing in value. People who are busy running around all day have nothing to do with making progress towards the most important tasks. Busy is often the smokescreen for real productivity. As author Tim Kreider said, "Yes, I know we are all very busy, but what, exactly, is getting done?"

The busier we are, the less energy, attention, and time we have to do those high-impact tasks that can truly move the needle. Therefore, being busy will keep us away from the success we are looking for. In fact, there are only a few things that truly matter. We need to be aware of these priorities, protect our time and save our energy for them. We should concentrate on doing high-impact tasks as much as possible. Less contribution, busywork is just distracting. It takes away our valuable time, attention, and energy from the few really important tasks. 

In a word, we should stop "acting busy" and stop celebrating it. Alternatively, we should honor those who cut out the busywork and focus their resources on the high-impact tasks that move the needle.

Productive means doing less but focusing on the most important tasks.
