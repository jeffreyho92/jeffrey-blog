In Johor Bahru, people will always talk about working in Singapore since it’s just a bridge away and earning Singapore dollars is much more lucrative due to the high currency exchange rates. I feel like want to work in Singapore also to earn SGD since the currency exchange rate was 1SGD to 2.6RM at that moment.<br>However, I have zero working experience in my career as a software engineer. I believe it will be very hard to get a job for me as a foreign worker, so I decided to work in Johor Bahru to gain more experience and improve myself.</p>\n<p>During my job search, my classmate got a job in a Malay company as a junior developer and he recommended me to join this company, so I went to an interview with his manager and successfully got a job offer with RM1200 monthly salary and the CEO also offer me to work in another branch in Kuala Lumpur. RM1200 is very low salary since the average for a fresh graduate student is RM1800 in JB, RM2200 in KL. At that time I felt like I needed more working experience so I accepted the job offer and start working immediately in JB.</p>\n<p>We need to work on Sunday, take off on Friday and Saturday since it’s a Malay company and I’m the only Chinese in whole company, so I have to accept the different culture. I can still remember that moment when my colleagues all go “sembahyang” pray twice a day during working hours, I’m the only one who stayed in office with no one else. However I’m still good with my colleagues and learned a lot from them.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I quit this company after 3 days but I still learned a lot. I saw that a government project has the potential to make billions of Ringgit. I felt like it’s very hard to accept their culture and I don’t like their project planning, every time have to do OT to rush their project timeline, luckily I did not accept the job offer that required me to move to KL.</p>\n<p>Sometimes misfortune can actually be a blessing, I moved forward in my career and join another company, Panasonic.</p>\n"},{"title":"Working in Panasonic Senai","date":"2020-03-14T15:05:00.000Z","_content":"\nWhen I join Panasonic Senai as a software technician in 2015, my starting salary was only RM1600 and after 3 months of probation, it becomes RM1650.

Love the Problem, Not Your Solution\n\nPeople spending effort to build something nobody wants. A lot of people they are thinking about their idea is very good and start to build it immediately without finding the customer, they never do research about the market and find out their potential customers. Customers don't care about your solutions, they care about their problems, no matter how great your product is.

Explain in a nutshell, the simplest solution is often the best solution. When the thing can be simple, don't make it complicated. When the complex solution and simple solution both work equally, we should choose the simple solution. The simpler a theory is, the more easily it can be verified. The simpler a solution is, the more easily it can be executed. \n\n>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. - Albert Einstein\n\nSometimes, we want to implement a solution that can solve a lot of problems or issues. We want to put all the things that we have into one solution to prove that what we can do, but this will make things more complicated.  We try to create one method that can solve everything. However, this will make things complicated to understand, bring more mistakes to occur, and it is unlikely to lead to a manageable prediction.\n\nA Mental model works best for making initial conclusions before the full information of the problem can be collected. We can have this mental model as a tool in our mental toolbox to give an immediate response when something happens.\n\nSimple is as simple does, we can choose the easiest solution to get thing done. It is better than stuck in a complex solution and do nothing.

It’s often a soft skill than a hard skill. Like communication, passion, or reliability. It delivers a unique value to your organization and allows you to control your salary because you will be in high demand.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your income right now is a result of your standards, it is not the industry, it is not the economy. - Tony Robbins</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You don’t always achieve your goals but you always improve your standard by doing it. To develop high-income skills, you need to increase your confidence with body language and communicate in the same ways as high earners. From the organization to the family, unclear communication can mess up everything. High-income earners consistently rate clear communication as an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p>People who earn a high income drives every decision with their passion. When we living our life with passion, we living life instead of working a job.  We can find meaning in our work instead of just looking for the salary. A job can be a larger life strategy. High earners plan on how to leverage the existing resources they currently have to generate more income, this is the most powerful high-income skill.</p>\n<p>Believe in the impossible is simply telling ourselves we can do it. At the end of the day, we won’t try the impossible if we don’t think there is a chance of success. In every moment, imagine that you are a high earner, what will you do in the current situation, learn a new skill to solve the problem if necessary. </p>\n<p>As Tony Robbins said, “Who you spend time with is who you become.” Surround ourselves with the right people is the most important thing. A negative environment can’t make us think positive. Successful people know the power of networking, they surround themselves with people they wanted to become. Find people who achieved what we want, figure out how they did it, and modeling them. </p>\n"},{"title":"Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills","date":"2020-12-27T15:59:00.000Z","_content":"\n> Hard skills are skills where the rules stay the same regardless of which company, circumstance, or people you work with.
