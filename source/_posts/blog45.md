In Japan, Ikigai is a concept of having a meaningful direction in life. It is a philosophy about finding a reason for being. It is about doing something you love and you are good at it, with the possibility of bringing value to other people. In most cases, Ikigai does not refer only to one's purpose in life, without regard to others or society. It is captured by the Ikigai diagram and includes overlapping these spheres, Love, Good At, Paid For, and Needs.

This diagram helps us gain further insights into our purpose in life and seeking what we are enjoying to do.
