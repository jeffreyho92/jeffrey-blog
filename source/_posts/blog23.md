Every human being has strengths and weaknesses, we should focus on our strengths or fix the weaknesses, this is a deep question in our life. Based-on the wood barrel theory, the shortest plank is way more important than the longest plank, you can't bring more water with longer plank cause water will lacking from the shortest plank, this reflects as a weak point in a person. In most of the case, we can do a lot with our strengths but sometimes we will fail in our weaknesses. Thus, we have to admit it, highlighting them, diagnosing them, thinking about what should be done differently in the future, in order to fix the weaknesses.

You may feel that recognizing our weak point is not that easy process, we need to do the reflection on the mistake we did, understand the root cause, and admit on it. Finding out that you are wrong is even more valuable than being right because you are learning, you are fixing the shorter plank of your life.

Indeep, sometimes we had identified our weak point but we don't know how to solve it, it will bring more stress altogether. However, when we understand the problem we have, we can look into it more details, start researching to find out the solution, read something that can enhance our mindset. When you realized you don't know, means that you already know.  

>Yet fixing unacceptable problems is actually a lot easier than not fixing them, because not fixing them will make you miserable. - Ray Dalio

I strongly believe that we need to fix our weaknesses, try to improve a little bit on it and life will be better when we conquer it. Even though we can't overcome our weak point in some cases, at least we can avoid it when we know what it is and do more things to cover it, it will be more beneficial than knowing nothing about it.
