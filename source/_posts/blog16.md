I feel so glad that I'm an optimistic person and think positive, I always think the best thing will happen and I believe everything happens for a reason no matter it's good or bad. 

Human makes mistakes, some people don't look at their mistake and blame to other things or person. But I think we need to learn from our mistakes and learn how to admit to it, this is not easy and we need to expose us to the feedback. Some people thought the mistake is bad, it discloses personal weaknesses and makes them look stupid. Though I think we need to prevent mistake but when it happens, we require to accept it and it will help us to recognize our weaknesses, this is essential for our learning.

Great people none of them were born great, they all made lots of mistakes and had lots of weaknesses. That great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them.

Mistake makes failure, our first impression when we face failure, we feel so bad and unsettling, we think why we are the only one who got it, why this happens to me, why I'm so unlucky. But we have got to think about why this bad thing happens, it may happen due to ourselves, not others. 

If we learn from failure, we may successfully deal with the realities of life. Failure is like a stone, we can choose to throw away the stone, or use the stone to step-ups on it, then the bad thing will become a good thing. It is not easy to review our failure, recall all the mistakes we did, and make a reflection on it. In spite of it, if we can get this skill set, we can adapt to any environment, no matter how we are and where we are, we can become better and better.
