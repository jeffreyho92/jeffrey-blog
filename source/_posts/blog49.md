In IT, we pretend that everyone else understands our product and know how to use it. You can have the best tools in the world, but if no one uses them, it doesnâ€™t matter. This tends to be a problem across the board in the IT area. Even if this happens in other fields related to IT, such as security and operations. If we can't even get all of the tech people on the same phase, it will be harder to get other people on board like marketing and business. Because of that, technical skills alone aren't enough to be effective. We need to let other people be able to understand our idea. We need to be able to communicate to let people know what the problem is, and what solution we are providing, and why it is necessary.

The same policies apply across technology functions. If people see our product as a roadblock, if the tools require more works to them, they don't want to use it. That's why soft skills are important, it is the key to success in tech career, not only hard skills are required. If we can communicate with those different types of people, we will be much better at our job, no matter what type of job we are working on.

In order to get improve in soft skills. Treat soft skills the same way as we would any technical skills. Communication skills are likely to be listed as 'soft' but that does not mean they are easy to learn or acquire. Sometimes soft skill is easy to get started but it is hard to become expert. Although it is difficult to be an expert in this field, it is still possible for us to improve on our soft skills.
