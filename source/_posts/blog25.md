People keep moving forward with gaining new knowledge. Learning is the very first step of change, learning is just a small part of the puzzle, but it's the most important part. Sometimes we feel hard to take the step out due to procrastination or lack of intention, or maybe we read it once then we thought we had learned about it, but this is not true.

As Alvin Toffler mentioned in his book, the 21st-century learning process:

>Learn -> Unlearn -> Re-learn

Learn: Getting the new things that we had never seen or known before, and take it as our knowledge.
Unlearn: After we learn the knowledge, it is open to objection. We should do some reflection on it, is it matching with our faith, should we agree with that point of view, we can be opposed to it.
Re-learn: After the reflection process, we re-learn the knowledge and come out with our own beliefs. This is such an important process that we can learn the knowledge that suite our past and future.

As Chris Do mention in his video, this is the new generation of the education process:

>Self-learning -> Critical thinking -> Articulation

Self-learning: We can learn what we wanted to learn through searching Google, read a book, join an online course, subscript MOOC, or even learn from a stranger.
Critical thinking: After we learn the new thing, we start a debate on it, think about how it is work, and is it a reliable knowledge, and how we can use it in our own.
Articulation: After we process the new learning to become our knowledge, we share it with people around us, it can be written in a post or article, repeat thinking about the knowledge. We should speak out loud for sharing and it can strengthen our memory.

Learning is from an input, and processing becomes an output, we consume the knowledge we learn, reflect on it, and implement it in our life.
