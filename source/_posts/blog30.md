It is common to hear the advice that people should take some risk and uncertainty if they want to be successful. Risk can separate into two different types, calculated risk, and non-calculated risk. I think knowing what you do and taking a risk with knowledge is calculated risk. When you have the knowledge of the things you are doing, you can handle the uncertainty, you can calculate the risk.

However, does risk-taking can lead to success or it is essential to be successful? For me, the answer depends on several factors, different people doing the same thing can lead to a different result. Successful people tend to take risks in ways that limit their potential losses.

>Entrepreneurs are not risk takers. They are calculated risk takers. - Leonard C. Green

"The difference between risk-takers and calculated risk-takers is the difference between failure and success," Green said. To be honest, this ideal looks like a survivorship bias, when the risk-taker becomes successful, we will think this is a good risk to take, but when the risk-taker becomes a failure, we will think this is a bad risk. In order to avoid survivorship bias, we need to look at the same thing in different ways and different perspectives. Take some time to study to get knowledge, we should look at the failure case, it is way more important than look at the success case. When we have the knowledge, we know how to play the game and applying some strategies.

Risk-taking does have some relative with success, but there are too many complicated factors to say that taking the risk will increase your chances to become successful. Even though those successful people also need to find ways to mitigate damage and lower the risks they take.
