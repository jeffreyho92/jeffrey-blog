>It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. - Epictetus

What sets the world's successful people apart is not what happens to them, but how they react to the things that happened to them. It's their response to a challenge or a difficulty that separates them from most of us. When something happens, the only thing you can control is your attitude toward it, you can either accept it or blame it.

When we run into an obstacle such as the covid pandemic, it is easy to just give up and throw in the white towel. However, this will not be going to make our life any better. I saw a lot of people around me they think 2020 should end as quickly as possible to avoid any bad things happen. I don't think that is a good mindset to have. I think that we can reflect on what we did during this crisis, and how we can improve on it. For example, we should prepare for uncertainty like having multiple sources of income for diversity. To be our best self as often as possible, be equipped for our path towards a better future.

If possible, inspire others to do the same in that process. Remember, we are in the same challenge together. People need a spark of light in these times, and we can decide to be that light. When we doing reflect on other people, we are learning from their experiences too, we can use it as our observation. 

During the stay at home period, we can learn some new skills that will help us to be better, it is the time for us to improve ourself. Finish a few tasks that we are wanted to do for a long time, so we can start with a clean sheet.
