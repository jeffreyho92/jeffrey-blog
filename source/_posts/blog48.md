Knowing how to ask a question is the art of conversation. Socrates' most meaningful thought is also known as Socratic Questioning. For example, rather than the student receiving the teacher filling the mind to them, both are responsible for pushing the conversation forward. There are two ways of communication to improve the student learning from the teacher.

>I know you wonâ€™t believe me, but the highest form of human excellence is to question oneself and others - Socrates

Socratic questioning usually having attributes as below:
1. Concise, directed, and clear: The attention remains on the other person and should avoid complicated meaning. In order to reduce confusion, we should ask a question directly without too much retouching the sentence.
2. Open, yet with purpose:  Asking a meaningful question to increase the engagement of the person. There is a clear intention to make the other invited party actively participate.
3. Focused but tentative: The point is on the discussion, focusing on the issue, not the person. Asking questions on the point but yet does not assume the other person has the answer.
4. Neutral: The questioning must be pointed to the person's perspective to get their opinion. It should not include or suggest the preferred answer. It does not guide the conversation to follow your opinion.

We can manage the timing in the conversation. Allow time for the other person to respond to the questions without feeling hurried. Let the person think about your question, so we can get the true deep thought. 

Regularly summarize what has been said. Let all the people understand what had been discussing and the whole idea in the conversation. Invite people to explain their idea, and bring about self-discovery through questioning. Keep the conversation focused, specific, and clearly worded.

According to science and research has confirmed that Socratic questioning provides students with positive support in enhancing critical thinking skills.
