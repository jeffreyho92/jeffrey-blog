In a day, we all have a short period of natural time, during which time we will feel the most energetic and awake.

It is called peak energy time. It can be in the early morning or late at night. During the peak energy time, we tend to have better attention and concentration, clear thinking, and less distraction.

When we are in our peak energy time, it will be more efficient and productive. It is wise to spend time on our high-impact and complex tasks. Unfortunately, most people are not aware of their peak energy time, which leads to inefficient use of their time. Most people waste their peak energy time by working on low-impact tasks instead of high-impact tasks. It means we need to work more hours to have the same level as leverages the peak energy time. It is like fighting an unnecessary hard battle. 

According to the research, most people have peak energy time in the morning. My peak energy time is between 9 AM and 12 PM which is why I enjoy doing my deep work in those hours. During the afternoon, I often lose energy, and then I use this time to do some low-impact tasks such as checking emails. For me, trying to concentrate on my work in the afternoon is usually the prescription for disaster. However, in my peak energized morning, it is very easy to concentrate. Of course, everyone has their own peak energy time. It could be at night or midnight.

Understand our peak energy time and use it to improve our productivity. Use it to complete the most complicated tasks, which require all our energy and cognitive resources. This is how we work wisely.
