Back then in 2016, I was working in Panasonic Senai as a software engineer, I got an opportunity to travel to Japan with a business trip. At that time I have just working in Panasonic Senai around 9 months, and one of the departments in our company just setting up a new system developed by Panasonic Japan members. By chance, I had been assigned to maintain this system and handle future enhancement. In order to handover the system, Japan members requested I to travel to Tokyo to meet them and they will handover all the information related to this system to me.

This is my first-time travel to Japan and Tokyo, I felt very excited to visit Tokyo since it is a prosperous city and the top fashion culture in Asia. I did a lot of research about it and planned my travel schedule and those places I wanted to visits. This business trip is around 6 days and I need to work from 9 am to 5 pm, but I still able to travel around after work. I work with Japan members in the Panasonic Tokyo office, it is a sales distribution center, that's why it allocated in the Tokyo city in a huge office building. 

My department head was with me for the first two days on this business trip, he brought me to having dinner with Japan members after work. We went to have some drinks, it is a Japanese Beer Buffet with snacks. After that, he leaves me alone to work with Japan members.      He guild me to learn how to take the train to the office from the hotel that we stay in, but I was once get lost when I went off from the office to the hotel. I'm using GPS and Google Maps but I still can't find the way to the hotel, luckily I asked a Japanese to guild me back, I took one hour lost and back to the hotel that only needs 10 mins journey.

The Japan member treated me very well, he brought me to travel around after work, he guild me on how to go to the place I wanted to visits. They also bought me some lunch since the living cost in Tokyo is very high, a meal costs around 35 Ringgit Malaysia, it is very expensive for me since I'm just a fresh graduate with a low salary at that moment.

This is a very special experience for me,  I felt that Japan is very big different compare with Malaysia, the culture and the society are very unique and attractive. I felt blessed to have this opportunity to travel to Tokyo Japan, thanks to my department head and the Japan members.
