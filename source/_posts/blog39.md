Everything is different nowadays, distraction is everywhere and happened anytime. There are so many things that distracted our attention and took away our time. We take our smartphones with us everywhere we go, we spend a lot of time on social media, messages, and news. We got distracted more often than we'd like. The reason why we got it is one of the biggest secrets that most tech-companies don't want us to know.

Dopamine Hacking. 

>Dopamine is a neurochemical which is released every time your brain anticipates a reward such as entertainment, information, novelty, or stimulation.

When dopamine is released, it makes us feel good, so our brain wants more of it. Just like a fat kid who loves chocolate cake. This is why our brain will stimulate us to repeat the behaviors that led to a dopamine release.

Common distractions such as social media, news, and even email have been intentionally designed to trigger an incredibly strong dopamine release. It is much more dopamine release than most of our work does. It is purposely chosen by the companies behind the apps. In fact, their entire business model depends on it. The stronger the dopamine release, the more time we will spend on these distractions, and the more money they make.

This is a concept called "attention-hacking". It happened when we want to do something that matters most at the time like reading or study. We got distracted from our smartphone, it gave us an immediate response with dopamine release, we got addicted to it as we felt happy and enjoyable. It's quickly destroying people's ability to stay focused. Our brain is being hijacked by meaningless things, and it prevents us from working on meaningful things.

When we understand this concept, we will be able to easily block distractions in our daily life and allow us to focus deeply on things that truly matter.
