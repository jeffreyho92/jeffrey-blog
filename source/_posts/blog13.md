In Panasonic Senai, we have a department managing the raw material for the production lines, they control the material that needed in the production to ensure the production lines can run smoothly. They have to work with Store members to prepare the raw material followed by the production plan, all the material will move to the production warehouse from the Store warehouse.

Before production lines start running and produce finish goods, they follow the material listing to collect all the raw materials needed for the production, each product has at least 20 raw materials. They need to collect and count the material carefully since different material has a different quantity for each type of product, they need to follow the material listing and production plan and split it into multiple production lines. Sometimes there have some quality issues in the production line that running haft way, they need to stop the production and collect back all the raw material and put the balance back to the production warehouse. These business processes are involved in a lot of manual processes and it costs a lot of manpower. In order to enhance these processes, top management requested the IT department to implement a system to optimize it.

When our department working on this project, I had been assigned to join in and support the implementation. After we study and understand the whole process, we implemented some new processes for them to work with the system to reduce the workload and prevent human error, instead of doing everything in manual ways. They can download the enhanced material listing that auto-generate with production plans and production lines. We also implement the QR code system to help them to collect material and manage production warehouse. This system can reduce around 50% of the workload and prevent inventory discrepancies. They do the stock check with more efficiently and accurately, they increate the stock check routine to weekly from twice a month. However, in the beginning, we need to put a lot of effort to implement it, design the layout, printout the QR code, and allocate it one by one.

This is a huge change for them, they need to adapt to the new process and change their working habit, this is not easy for them since they are used to the old manual process, they need to be open-minded to accept the new things that can improve their workload.
