"I don't know what to do"
"I don't know how to do it"
"I don't have the chance to do it"
"I will be very hard working if I got the opportunity to do it"

When I look at people who hustle into something, work for his own business, I felt like if I got the chance to work on my own business, I will be very hard working too. However, how to get the chance is a big question for me. Most of the people have this feeling in their life too, we always waiting for someone to provide us the opportunity to spend time and hustle into something.

Refer to those articles that I read, and do some study on it, they always talk about some common points. If you want to master a skill, you have to understand it, it takes practice, time, and persistence. Ask yourself, who is the leader in the industry that is absolutely crushing it, who is the icon in that specific field, who is the first person that you recall in your mind. We can do some research on what makes them successful, what skills are required to achieve your target. Map out the list of things that you would like to implement and start practicing.

We should start with setting an intention, identify what skillset needs to learn, then comes practice, then comes failing, then comes learning, then it is a habit and becomes a part of you. Consistency is the key, consistency leads to habits. This learning process is a formula that we can implement in almost everything. 

>It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It’s what we do consistently. - Anthony Robbins

Remind ourselves, if you wait to be ready, you will be waiting forever. Take the first step to get started is more important than waiting for the perfect time to start.
