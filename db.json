In Johor Bahru, people will always talk about working in Singapore since it's just a bridge away and earning Singapore dollars is much more lucrative due to the high currency exchange rates. I feel like want to work in Singapore also to earn SGD since the currency exchange rate was 1SGD to 2.6RM at that moment. \nHowever, I have zero working experience in my career as a software engineer. I believe it will be very hard to get a job for me as a foreign worker, so I decided to work in Johor Bahru to gain more experience and improve myself.\n\nDuring my job search, my classmate got a job in a Malay company as a junior developer and he recommended me to join this company, so I went to an interview with his manager and successfully got a job offer with RM1200 monthly salary and the CEO also offer me to work in another branch in Kuala Lumpur. RM1200 is very low salary since the average for a fresh graduate student is RM1800 in JB, RM2200 in KL.

I can still remember that moment when my colleagues all go \"sembahyang\" pray twice a day during working hours, I'm the only one who stayed in office with no one else. However I'm still good with my colleagues and learned a lot from them.\n\nUnfortunately, I quit this company after 3 days but I still learned a lot. I saw that a government project has the potential to make billions of Ringgit. I felt like it's very hard to accept their culture and I don't like their project planning, every time have to do OT to rush their project timeline, luckily I did not accept the job offer that required me to move to KL.\n\nSometimes misfortune can actually be a blessing, I moved forward in my career and join another company, Panasonic.","source":"_posts/blog1.md","raw":"---\ntitle: First step in my career\ndate: 2020-03-08 22:50:00\ntags: blog\n---\n\nBack then, I was a Diploma graduate in 2015 who was young, dumb and broke.

The scopes of in-house software are supporting internal business workflows, improve productivity and increase product quality. Since all software is used by our employees, so as a software developer, I have to understand our company’s business workflows and what are they doing in each department.</p>\n<p>I still can remember when I had been assigned to support a Purchase Request system. I have to work with the Corporate Purchasing Department. I did the feasibility study of purchasing workflow. It is quite a complicated workflow involved clerk, purchaser, administrator, and vendor. A purchase request basically can split into two categories which are Regular Request and Ad-hoc Request. The Regular Request is repeatable every week or every month, so it has a fixed vendor. The Ad-hoc Request is a special request like ordering a machine or purchase a service. The ad-hoc request needs management to approve and get acknowledgment.</p>\n<p>In order to get a clear idea of the process, I have to follow the purchaser run through the whole process, like a clerk submit a request form to request purchase, the administrator verifies the request and gets approval from management. Finance has to approve the request then the purchaser submits a purchase order to the vendor and gets the delivery timeline from the vendor.
