> Hard skills are skills where the rules stay the same regardless of which company, circumstance, or people you work with. In contrast, soft skills are skills where the rules changes depending on the company culture and people you work with. - Lei Han

Hard skills are measurable and most often technical skills, such as accounting and engineering. Soft skills are intangible and difficult to quantify, such as leadership and communication.

In work, hard skills help us to make confident decisions, but they do not help the foundation of communication and interaction with people around us. Business is not a machine, it is groups of people working together to achieve something.

LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner says “interpersonal skills are where we're seeing the biggest imbalance. Communications is the number one skills gap". LinkedIn’s 2018 Workforce Report found that the four most in-demand soft skills are leadership, communication, collaboration, and time management. 

Soft skills can be very hard to learn since it required an internal mind change. There is some debate about the importance of soft skills and hard skills that affect work or life. However, they are both necessary and equivalent to one another.

Soft skills often provide the foundation for high emotional intelligence (EQ). EQ is the ability to identify and manage our emotions, and also the ability to understand one's emotions. When Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is related to technical skills, EQ accounts for 90% of what makes people move up the success ladder.

Mind-body awareness is an important soft skill. It helps us from reading the room and reading others before we are consciously aware of them. Mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation help us monitor ourselves and understand our mind. This kind of self-awareness also increases empathy. Empathy is useful in work or life. Think the way of others, put ourselves in one's shoes, help us understand more in the circumstance, and control our emotions. Such habits allow us to engage more deeply with other people.

Focus on improving soft skills such as listening and empathy with a growth mindset that will bring us an unfair advantage in work and life.
