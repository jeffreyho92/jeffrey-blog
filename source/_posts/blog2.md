When I join Panasonic Senai as a software technician in 2015, my starting salary was only RM1600 and after 3 months of probation, it becomes RM1650. This is quite a low salary but I felt excited went to work every day since I knew this is just temporary. I knew I can earn more salary in the future when I got more working experience.

Panasonic Senai is a manufacturer that produces telephone machines and fax machines with employed around 1000 employees including foreign workers. In Infomation System Department, we have 2 teams which are Infra team and Software team. I'm working in the Software team with 5 colleagues. In the beginning, my manager was led me to join the existing projects and understand the company's system structure. Our team was assigned to support all in-house systems so I have to cooperate with other colleagues from other departments. I have to understand what are they doing and how the system can solve their problems. I found that it's a big difference in actual working experience compare with what I learned in theory before.

After 3 months I was assigned to run a small project alone. It's a booking system for book meeting rooms. Before I started this project, people who want to book a meeting room have to manage in an excel file which allocated in a shared folder. It's very hard to check daily appointments and people have to calculate the available time manually. Sometimes people will accidentally remove or edited other people's bookings. So I planed and developed a web application to solve these issues, it's a calendar-based application, people can check and make a booking with a user-friendly interface.

One day I saw a colleague using this application to easily manage her booking and she told me it's a very useful application. This is the first time I saw people using an application that developed by me, it's an impressing feeling, I felt blessed to doing this.
