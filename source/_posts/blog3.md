>You make your own luck - Jason Roberts

How do you increase your chance of success? Your "Luck Surface Area" can help you. This is a term coined by Jason Roberts in a 2010 blog post. When the first time I saw this term I felt shocked, I did not know luck can have a surface area and you can control the amount of luck that you receive. 

As I understand it, when you contribute something and people aware of it, you will get more opportunities. When you pour energy into a passion, you become an expert in one field, somebody will look for you. This idea does match my belief. I've always thought about learn more things and do more work will lead me to wider possibilities. When you do something you are passionate about and do something is valuable, people will feel interested and try to capture that value. When people need you more than you need people, you started to be valuable.

This is the graphical representation that really brings the concept home. However, I does not like the word "tell" in here instead of "aware". Cause I think let people aware of your value is better than tell people what you have, it is harder to achieve though.

Although, how to make people aware of your value is a big question, it can be a long journey. Even though you are an expert in doing something but people do not aware of it, it will become nothing. Let others know of your worth are equally important and commonly be overlooked.
