According to research, most people are most efficient during the first two hours of the morning. The morning is often the peak time of productivity. Most people tend to be energetic, focused, and clear-minded. The disciplined people use the morning time to knock down the one most high-impact task that is the most complex and intimidating.

There are several key benefits to starting our most important task early in the morning. Firstly, when we completed the most energy-draining task in the day, the rest of the day feels like fulfilled. The day is pretty much a big success before the afternoon. Secondly, the use of this rule can prevent us from delaying the tasks that have the greatest impact on our goals and make the most progress.

Usually, we tend to delay on important tasks because these tasks are very complex and energy-consuming. They are always put off until tomorrow and the future. However, if we try to set at least one priority before the afternoon, we can no longer procrastinate on the tasks anymore.

Because the most important tasks require our 100% attention, it is good practice to use the morning peak hours to complete one of the tasks instead of doing paperwork, replying to messages, or answering emails.

>If you want to get the most out of your day, do your most important work "your one thing" early. - Gary Keller

I try my best to make full use of the peak hours in the morning to complete the most important task of the day. At this moment, my mind is the clearest, my attention is the most concentrated, and mental clarity. When I try to do this in the afternoon, I just struggle to stay focused and it requires more energy consumption.

After completing the high-impact tasks before the afternoon, I gain a sense of accomplishment and motivation for the rest of the day.
