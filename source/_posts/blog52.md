>The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks, and starting on the first one - Mark Twain

This advice is simple but strong, it contains many ideas. Most of the time, when we have a big idea, we get excited about it. However, it is so difficult when we want to work on it, it is so complicated until we didn't manage to get the start. One of the most common reasons why we tend to procrastinate is because our tasks are overwhelming, complex, or require a long-term effort.

Although, by breaking down a complex idea into some small, manageable tasks, it loses its complexity and becomes much less intimidating. After that, we can get start the simplest and most specific task, and finish it. Then, we continue to the next task, and the next one goes out. This helps us to have a clear list of things we want to do. Simply repeating this process over and over again can help us achieve the bigger ideas, projects, or goals that we are aiming for. And this is the essence of Mark Twain's advice, small daily actions compounded over time lead to big 
results.

Want to start working out? That's great. But it is overwhelming and intimidating. To avoid procrastinating on the complex goal, break it down into a list of small daily tasks, to have an idea of the progress. For example, start with a short time, but keep doing it every day, and then slowly increase the time when we are used to it. Through every small and manageable daily action we accomplish, we are one step closer to achieving this big and ambitious goal.

Whenever you want to procrastinate, just remember, just take one small step and finish it. There is no harm in doing a small task, at least there is a little progress on it.
