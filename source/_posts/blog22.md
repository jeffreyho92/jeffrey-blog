I was often thinking about how to be a success in my career and what I need to do to achieve it. This question brings along with another question, what is a successful career and how can we measure it. I have a faith that as long as I keep learning and improving, I am in the direction of the place or position that I thought is a successful career. 

However, sometimes I saw people around me who had been done some achievements or make more money than me at the same age, I just concerning how they can do it and what skill or attribute that requires for it. The more I think the more I realized that the important point is in their thinking patterns, they always think about what people want, not what they want to give. When we try to understand people and studying what is helpful for people, we provide our value to people and get success from it. 

>They simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it. - Ray Dalio

Ray Dalio wrote in his book, Principles, identify a project you will be facing in the near future and apply the principles of mental creation write down the results you desire, and what steps will lead to those results.

The direction of our target and knowing what we want is the most important things and it is essential for all of us. If we want to become a millionaire, we need to think like a millionaire and act like them so as to become one of them. I need to be clear about my goals, focus on the things I desire, and what is the required ability to achieve it. It will be a long journey but I feel very interested in it like an adventure.
