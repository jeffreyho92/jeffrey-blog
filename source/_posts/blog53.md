Sometimes I wonder why some people are able to achieve so many things, and how they can do them in such a short time? I found a common idea after doing some research. The most productive people do not necessarily work much more than others around them. In fact, sometimes it even takes less than 40 hours a week to work. Instead of working more time, they give priority to their works and work smarter. Instead of working more hours, they prioritize their works and working smarter. They focus on maximizing their working hours, instead of "acting busy". This is how they can achieve better results in the same period or even in a shorter period.

>The people who achieve extraordinary results donâ€™t achieve them by working more hours. They achieve them by getting more done in the hours they work. - Gary Keller

Deep work is one of the ways to get the maximum effect from our working time. 
Practicing deep work is when we work on our Most Valuable Task (MVT) in a "Flow State". The most valuable tasks are the task that can contribute the greatest advantage, progress, and benefits much more than other tasks. When we work on the most impact task simultaneously in a Flow State ensures we fully use our brain on this one task which allows us to complete it faster. Four hours' working time is equivalent to ten hours' normal working time. Generally speaking, this is one of the secrets to maximize our productivity and achievement.

>To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. - Cal Newport

When we do something with Deep Work which feels like a superpower. It is a very important skill in the world that becoming more and more distracting. Therefore, as a point of action, we can start practicing Deep Work in a 90-minute time. Choose one of the Most Valuable Tasks and take 90 minutes to finish it without smartphone, social media, or things that interfere with our Flow State.
