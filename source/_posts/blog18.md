Life keeps require us to make decisions, each decision is linked to the next decision. When we are in school, we make the decision that we want to study hard or play hard, it was linked to another decision after we graduated. If we choose to continue to study and go into college, we need to pick what course we want and make another decision again. If we choose to get a job, we have to think about what we can do and which field we want to work on, it requires another decision. Each decision is like a chain that links to the next opportunity and it is very hard to reverse back.

We aren't born with the ability to make good decisions, but we can learn about it. Everyone starts from zero experience, no one had the knowledge. In the beginning, someone may have an unfair advantage like the environment they bornt, though. We will start with a lot of the decisions we made, no matter good or bad decisions. Whenever we realized we make a bad decision, we should accept the cause and effect, we shouldn't blame on it and felt regret about the decision we made. I think this will waste the effort that we did for making the decision, it could be an important experience in our life, it could help us to avoid the next bad decision that could happen. 

The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we made. When something requires us to make a decision, we can pick the easiest option, and accept it to fall as commonplace. However, the easiest option may not be a good decision, we should try to execute a different decision, gain a different experience so that we can make a change in our life. 

Fortune is grasped by our own hands, we can draft our life with unexpected results.
