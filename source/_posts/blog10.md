Configuration Business in a manufacturing company

Back then in 2016, I was working in Panasonic Senai for about one year. My company just started a new department with a new business modal which is C&R, C&R stands for Configuration and Repair. This business is focused on support Panasonic's laptop and tablet which are TOUGHBOOK and TOUGHPAD. They do the customize configuration for the new devices such as install GPS sensors or upgrade software and OS. And the repair team will focus on repair customer's TOUGHBOOK such as hardware that broken or spoilt. 

There is a huge demand from oversea counties like the UK and the US. Panasonic in the UK has a company which doing the same thing as C&R but the labor costs are very high, so we have the cost advantage in Malaysia. Most of the new devices are produced in Taiwan, then they will ship to us and do configuration before send out to customers.

The complicated part of this business is in the inventory. Since we can't stock all the configuration parts and devices, so we have to keep track of the Sales Order to do the forecast for goods requests and orders. C&R members have to make sure all the parts are getting ready on time when the devices have arrived and start doing configuration immediately and ship out in short timing. 

This business was authorized by Panasonic Japan, they sent some people from Japan to here to set up the production environment and give training for C&R members. C&R members have to follow the SOP that given by Japan and follow the documentation for each operation.

We also have a new system developed by Japan members and implemented in C&R, this system will help us to manage all the production process and workflow. I had been assigned to maintain this system and do the enhancement on our own, so I have to fully understand the whole business process in each workflow. 

This allowed me to learn something new from Japan members and the business model that is not often seen in the market.
