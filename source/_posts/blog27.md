Sometimes we thought we have to be knowledgeable to become successful, but in fact, not all the professors or scientists they can achieve success in life, even though they study a lot. Sometimes we thought we need to be hardworking to become successful but in fact, most of the foreign workers can't achieve success in life, even though they are very hardworking on their work.

When I look at a successful person who has some disadvantages, I'm thinking about how he or she can be successful with such defeats. They could be being rude or be emotional with someone, how they can achieve success with doing such bad things, why we being a good person but can't achieve something in our life. Though I still suffering in this thinking, but I realized that no one is saying that being a good person definitely can be a success in life. We still need to put hard work on something that we really desired to achieve, being a good person is just a choice as a human, although it's not easy being kind all the time.

Successful people can be unkind people. Nobody is perfect, people can be successful in their careers but fail in personal life, people can be kind in their family but doesn't look successful in other people's perspectives.

Good person won't necessarily to become successful. I think the point here is not about being a good person or a bad person. The point here is how we determine success, it could be a different thing in different people's life. However, keep improving ourselves to become better is essential to become successful, nobody is keeping the worst to achieve success. Fortunately, life is not fair but it is still good.
