>Knowledge is not power, it is potential power. Execution will trump knowledge any day - Tony Robbins

A lot of people saying that knowledge is power, without knowledge we can't do anything, but owning knowledge without action also do nothing. I have been too influenced by Knowledge, I enjoy learning new things but yet less execution. The necessity of taking action appropriately is more powerful than knowing knowledge.

How many people around you know a lot of things but do nothing about it? We regularly find out the issue but do not take any action to fix it. We used to ignore the issue since it is easier than find out the solution. As is told that knowledge without action is useless. We all know that we must take action but it is easier said than done.

I'm not saying that learning knowledge is useless. Action without knowledge is aimless, it may bring in more troubles, we can't go somewhere we are not familiar with without a navigator. Nowadays we can learn everything from internal everywhere every time. Everyone can get knowledge, it is cheap without execution. Gaining knowledge and understanding is wisdom, it is the first step before taking action, it was a tool waiting to be used. However, missing out on the action leaves our knowledge worthless. 

Learning how to swim from a swimming video doesn't make us really can swim, it needs real practice and implementation. As reading provides knowledge, it also ensures that the necessary action needs to be taken. 

Knowledge is like an ax, it needs someone to use it to cut down a tree. This making the idea a simple yet powerful weapon.
