Nowadays we are no longer demographics, we are psychographic. People living in the same area may have different interests or lifestyle. In the words of motivational speaker, Vusi Thembekwayo: "A kid living in Kuala Lumpur who has never been out of Kuala Lumpur sounds like a kid in Brooklyn New York because he watches Jay Z on Youtube. So he is completely immersed in that culture even though he never left his small little village." No matter where we are, what we watch or read might change our identity. We will get influenced by those things we are interested in.

We often heard that "You are the average of the five people spend the most time with". The people around you may shape who you are. When we are talking to a negative person, we will be affected by negative mindsets. When we are surrounded by people who love to talk about business, we will learn the knowledge of the business from them. People of a mind fall into the same group.

Successful people pay attention to networking. They care about who they spend time with and how people affected them. They proactively surround by people who more successful than themselves, so they can learn from them and keep improving. It is the key to have a growth mindset, which can be influenced by other people.

Surround with successful people may help you become successful. You might discover something from successful people in your subconscious mind without notice it. You might learn from their mindset, follow their way of thinking, and wanted to achieve success as them.

Hang out with people who inspire you to become better. Research for people you wanted to be an inspiration, learn from what they have done, and model them.
