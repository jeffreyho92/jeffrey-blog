Four big lessons that guide the business thinking from the entrepreneurs who come from Silicon Valley, after the dot-com bubble.

1. Make incremental advances: A lot of entrepreneurs dream big and wanted to change the world. They are enjoying the brilliant idea that may change the way of how the world is working. They are seeking incredible fast growth and ignore the tiny little disadvantage. They prefer short term advantage instead of long term advantage. However, the focus on constant growth is the key. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward.

2. Stay lean and flexible: "All companies must be lean, which is code for unplanned." We can't predict the future of the business. We should not know what it will do, planning is inflexible. We should prepare for the unknown circumstances, assume that we will be affected by the uncertainty. Instead, we should try things out, and treat entrepreneurship as experimentation.

3. Improve on the competition: "Don't try to create a new market prematurely." We should start with an existing customer to know that we are in a real business. We should improve the existing products that are already offered by successful competitors. By doing this, we can recognize that we are building something that somebody wants. 

4. Focus on product, not sales: "If your product requires advertising to sell it, it's not good enough. The only sustainable growth is viral growth." Salespeople are important, but the great product speaks for itself. Although we still need marketing, we should look at it as exposure. We should give the great product a chance to speaks.

These lessons have become dogma in the startup world. We should focus more on real demand instead of bright future ideas. We need to rethink what is needed for people and what is good to have but not important.
