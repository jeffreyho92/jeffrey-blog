If let me think about the busiest person in the world, I immediately think of Elon Musk. How he can get so many things done every single day 24/7. He could be the Busyman in the business world, or whatever you name it. He managing Teala, SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and the list keep going. Those companies he is working on that all changing the course of humanity. Even managing just one of those would be one hell of a project, every day dealing with uncertainty. I mean, with SpaceX alone he is trying to get us to Mars, this is insane.

Therefore, what does Elon Musk do differently from most other people, that makes him so extremely productive, get so many things done in all different area. Well, I think one thing is very clear, he is big on prioritization. He once said, "Focus on signal over noise. Don't waste time on stuff that doesn't actually make things better." This sounds like a simple idea that everyone was known, but it is not easy to apply in our daily tasks. We always get disturbed by urgent things, even though that is not really urgent. 

By considering reducing the things that don't matter (much), he frees up his limited time and energy for the things that do matter, and that is something we should all learn from him and apply in our daily jobs. First thing first and get things done.

When we prioritize the most valuable tasks over all the 'busywork' tasks, that is when we effectively improve our productivity. That is how we will be able to achieve much more in much less time. Everyone has the same amount of time, 24 hours per day, get more done in less time is the key.
