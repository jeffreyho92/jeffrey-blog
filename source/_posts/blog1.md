Back then, I was graduated from my Diploma in 2015, that was young, dumb and broke. In Johor Bahru, people will always talk about working in Singapore since its just a distance of a bridge then you can get a high currency exchange. I feel like want to work in Singapore also to earn SGD since the currency exchange rate was 1SGD to 2.6RM at that moment. 
However, I have zero working experience in my career as a software engineer. I believe it's very hard to get a job for me as a foreign worker, so I decided to work in Johor Bahru to gain more experience and improve myself.

During my job searching, my classmate got a job in a Malay company as a junior developer and he recommended me to join this company, so I went to an interview with his manager and successfully get a job offer with RM1200 monthly salary and the CEO also offer me to work in another branch in Kuala Lumpur. RM1200 is very low salary since the average for a fresh graduate student is RM1800 in JB, RM2200 in KL. At that time I feel like I need more working experience so I accepted the job offer and start working immediately in JB.

We need to work in Sunday, take off in Friday and Saturday since its a Malay company and I'm the only one Chinese in whole company, so I have to accept the different culture. I still can remember that moment when my colleagues all go "sembahyang" pray twice a day during working hours, I'm only one stay in office with no body. However I'm still good with my colleagues and learn from them.

Unfortunately, I quit this company after 3 days but I still learned a lot. I saw that how they can deal a government project and make one billions Ringgit for each project. I feel like its very hard to join thier culture and I don't like their project planning, every time have to do OT to rush their project timeline, luckily I never accept the job offer that required me to move to KL.

Sometimes misfortune may be an actual blessing, I moving forward in my career and join another company, Panasonic.
