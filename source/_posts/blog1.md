Back then, I was a Diploma graduate in 2015 who was young, dumb and broke. In Johor Bahru, people will always talk about working in Singapore since it's just a bridge away and earning Singapore dollars is much more lucrative due to the high currency exchange rates. I feel like want to work in Singapore also to earn SGD since the currency exchange rate was 1SGD to 2.6RM at that moment. 
However, I have zero working experience in my career as a software engineer. I believe it will be very hard to get a job for me as a foreign worker, so I decided to work in Johor Bahru to gain more experience and improve myself.

During my job search, my classmate got a job in a Malay company as a junior developer and he recommended me to join this company, so I went to an interview with his manager and successfully got a job offer with RM1200 monthly salary and the CEO also offer me to work in another branch in Kuala Lumpur. RM1200 is very low salary since the average for a fresh graduate student is RM1800 in JB, RM2200 in KL. At that time I felt like I needed more working experience so I accepted the job offer and start working immediately in JB.

We need to work on Sunday, take off on Friday and Saturday since it's a Malay company and I'm the only Chinese in whole company, so I have to accept the different culture. I can still remember that moment when my colleagues all go "sembahyang" pray twice a day during working hours, I'm the only one who stayed in office with no one else. However I'm still good with my colleagues and learned a lot from them.

Unfortunately, I quit this company after 3 days but I still learned a lot. I saw that a government project has the potential to make billions of Ringgit. I felt like it's very hard to accept their culture and I don't like their project planning, every time have to do OT to rush their project timeline, luckily I did not accept the job offer that required me to move to KL.

Sometimes misfortune can actually be a blessing, I moved forward in my career and join another company, Panasonic.
