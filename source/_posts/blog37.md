First-principles thinking is one of the best ways of reverse engineering for complicated problems. The idea is to break down complicated problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the group up.  First-principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. This way of thinking helps us removes the common assumptions that might be wrong, also knowns as Cognitive Bias.

Most of the time, people are reasoning by analogy. We look at something that was done before or something else that other people are doing it. A lot of things that we believe are based on some authority figure telling us that is true. As children, we learn to stop questioning when we are told "Because I said so." As adults, we learn to stop questioning when people say "Because that's how it works."

>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. - Albert Einstein

Children instinctively think in first principles. They like to ask "Why" until they understand the thing. However, audits will always think that we are doing this because it is always been done that way. We are not doing it because nobody else ever done that, so it must not be good. But this is just a lazy way of thinking. We have to build up the reasoning from the group up. We can try to understand the reality with what is true, not with our intuition.  If we let other people think for us means that we are using their analogies or their experiences. People's thinking is framed by someone else and it could be wrong.

The power of first-principles thinking is not only for improvement but also increases the possibility. Reasoning from first principles allows us to step outside of conventional wisdom. We can reason by first principles, by analogy, or a blend of the two.
