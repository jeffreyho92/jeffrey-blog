When we learned how to communicate, we start to cooperate as human beings. Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages between more than one person. Communication is the glue that holds organized people together. It is a way for us to connect with each other, exchange ideas, and learn from others.

First of all, people spread information or knowledge among people through communication. Teachers share their knowledge with their students, parents share their culture with their children, colleagues discuss their works with each other, companies exchange information with their customers, the list goes on and on. I believe that the importance of communication is like breathing, and humans can't live without it. Without communication, the knowledge process can't work, companies can't operate, and humans can't build relationships and keep together.

Communication is the basis of human relations. At first, strangers begin to talk and getting to know each other, and then more interaction will bring closer relations. Interaction helps us to express our feelings and understand each other's emotions and thoughts. However, it will generate hatred toward other people as well, negative or positive relationships will be created.

We need someone who can communicate! I often head this sentence from the professional recruiters or business areas. In fact that it is not meaningless. The research found out that, communication and interpersonal skills remain at the top of the list of what matters most to recruiters and corporations.

There is no doubt that communication is a very important and necessary skill in human life. It does not only help to develop relationships with others but also helpful to the process of sharing knowledge and information. Every day, we have to communicate with many different people, such as families or friends, and even strangers. We should effectively improve our communication to make our life better.
