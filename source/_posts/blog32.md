Mental Model represents how things work, or an explanation of a person's thinking process. Our thinking quality is based on the models in the brain, and our brain will automatically trigger different thinking models in different situations. The more models you have, the bigger your toolbox will be, and you will be able to look at the same thing with different thinking models and different perspectives.

1. Inversion
Its origins can be found in the word "invert", which is simply means "turn upside down". Normally, when we want to make a good impression, we will think about doing something good to prove ourselves, but we should think about what bad things we should not be done. It can also be like rather than thinking about what you want, consider what you'd like to avoid. 

2. Second-order thinking
Every action has a consequence and further consequences, it like a chain, connecting every action or circumstance. These are called second-order effects. In this model of thinking, we can think about the chained effect that will happen with all the actions we take, to avoid potentially making a bad decision. Second-order thinking enables us to discover the long-term result of our actions.

3. Pareto Principle
Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, often happens in our world, but we are not aware of it. The Pareto Principle specifies that for many results, 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes. To put it simply, 80% of the result we got came from 20% of our hard work, which means that we should use 20% of our time to focus on the most important thing that can bring us 80% of a good result. Accept imperfection, and stop being a perfectionist.

A mental model is a very good tool which can help us make better decisions in our life. However, it is not easily accessible but once we start using it, we will implement it on a daily basis in almost everything.
